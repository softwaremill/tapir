# Running using the AWS serverless stack

Tapir server endpoints can be packaged and deployed as an [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html) function. To invoke the function, HTTP requests can be proxied through [AWS API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html).

To configure API Gateway routes, and the Lambda function, tools like [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) can be used, to automate cloud deployments.

For an overview of how this works in more detail, see [this blog post](https://blog.softwaremill.com/tapir-serverless-a-proof-of-concept-6b8c9de4d396).

## Serverless interpreters

To implement the Lambda function, a server interpreter is available, which takes tapir endpoints with associated server logic, and returns an `AwsRequest => F[AwsResponse]` function. This is used in the `AwsLambdaIORuntime` to implement the Lambda loop of reading the next request, computing and sending the response.

Currently, only an interpreter integrating with cats-effect is available (`AwsCatsEffectServerInterpreter`). To use, add the following dependency:

```scala
"com.softwaremill.sttp.tapir" %% "tapir-aws-lambda" % "1.2.3"
```

To configure API Gateway and the Lambda function, you can use:

* the `AwsSamInterpreter` which interprets tapir `Endpoints` into an AWS SAM template file
* or the `AwsTerraformInterpreter` which interprets `Endpoints` into terraform configuration file.

Add one of the following dependencies:

```scala
"com.softwaremill.sttp.tapir" %% "tapir-aws-sam" % "1.2.3"
"com.softwaremill.sttp.tapir" %% "tapir-aws-terraform" % "1.2.3"
```

## Examples

In our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir/tree/master/serverless/aws/examples/src/main/scala/sttp/tapir/serverless/aws/examples)
you'll find a `LambdaApiExample` handler which uses `AwsCatsEffectServerInterpreter` to route a hello endpoint along
with `SamTemplateExample` and `TerraformConfigExample` which interpret endpoints to SAM/Terraform configuration. Go
ahead and clone tapir project and select `project awsExamples` from sbt shell.

Make sure you have [AWS command line tools installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

### SAM

To try it out using SAM template you don't need an AWS account.

* install [AWS SAM command line tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-command-reference.html)
* run `assembly` task and `runMain sttp.tapir.serverless.aws.examples.SamTemplateExample`
* open a terminal and in tapir root directory run `sam local start-api --warm-containers EAGER`

That will create `template.yaml` and start up AWS Api Gateway locally. Hello endpoint will be available
under `curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/hello`. First invocation will take a while but subsequent ones will be faster
since the created container will be reused.

### Terraform

To run the example using terraform you will need an AWS account, and an S3 bucket.

* install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
* run `assembly` task
* open a terminal in `tapir/serverless/aws/examples/target/jvm-2.13` directory. That's where the fat jar is saved. You
  need to upload it into your s3 bucket. Using command line
  tools: `aws s3 cp tapir-aws-examples.jar s3://{your-bucket}/{your-key}`.
* Run `runMain sttp.tapir.serverless.aws.examples.TerraformConfigExample {your-aws-region} {your-bucket} {your-key}`
* open terminal in tapir root directory, run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`

That will create `api_gateway.tf.json` configuration and deploy Api Gateway and lambda function to AWS. Terraform will
output the url of the created API Gateway which you can call followed by `/api/hello` path.

To destroy all the created resources run `terraform destroy`.

## Scala.js interpreter

`LambdaApiJsExample` and `LambdaApiJsResourceExample` demonstrate how to create an API route,
that can be built into Node.js module with Scala.js plugin.
Such module can be deployed as an AWS Lambda function with Node.js runtime.
The main benefit is the reduced deployment time.
Initialization of JVM-based application (with `sam local`) took ~11 seconds on average, while Node.js based one only ~2 seconds.

`LambdaApiJsExample` uses `AwsFutureServerInterpreter` and `JsRoute[Future]`,
which is an alias for the route function `AwsJsRequest => Future[AwsJsResponse]`.

`LambdaApiJsResourceExample` builds a `cats.effect.Resource` and uses `AwsCatsEffectServerInterpreter` and `JsRoute[IO]`.

### SAM example

SAM template and application module can be generated and deployed locally with following commands:

* to generate AWS Lambda yaml file run `sbt "project awsExamples; runMain sttp.tapir.serverless.aws.examples.SamJsTemplateExample"`
* to build Node.js module run `sbt "project awsExamplesJS; fastLinkJS"`, it will create all-in-one JS file
  under `tapir/serverless/aws/examples/target/js-2.13/tapir-aws-examples-fastopt/main.js`
* open a terminal and in tapir root directory run `sam local start-api --warm-containers EAGER`
