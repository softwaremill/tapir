# Server options

Each interpreter can be configured using an options object, which includes:

* how to create a file (when receiving a response that is mapped to a file, or when reading a file-mapped multipart 
  part)
* if, and how to handle exceptions (see [error handling](errors.md))
* if, and how to log requests (see [loggin & debugging](debugging.md))  
* how to handle decode failures (see [error handling](errors.md))
* additional user-provided interceptors

To use custom server options pass them as an argument to the interpreter's `apply` method.
For example, for `AkkaHttpServerOptions` and `AkkaHttpServerInterpreter`:

```scala
import sttp.tapir.server.interceptor.decodefailure.DecodeFailureHandler
import sttp.tapir.server.akkahttp.AkkaHttpServerOptions
import sttp.tapir.server.akkahttp.AkkaHttpServerInterpreter

val customDecodeFailureHandler: DecodeFailureHandler = ???

val customServerOptions: AkkaHttpServerOptions = AkkaHttpServerOptions
  .customInterceptors
  .decodeFailureHandler(customDecodeFailureHandler)
  .options
  
AkkaHttpServerInterpreter(customServerOptions)
```

## Request interceptors

Request interceptors intercept whole request, and are called once for each request. They can provide additional
endpoint interceptors, as well as modify the request, or the response.

The following request interceptors are provided by default (and if enabled, called in this order):

* the [metrics interceptor](observability.md), which by default is disabled
* the `RejectInterceptor`, which specifies what should be done when decoding the request has failed for all 
  interpreted endpoints. The default is to return a 405 (method not allowed), if there's at least one decode failure
  on the method, and a "no-match" otherwise (which is handled in an intereprter-specific manner)
  
## Endpoint interceptors

An `EndpointInterceptor` allows intercepting the handling of a request by an endpoint, when either the endpoint's inputs 
have been decoded successfully, or when decoding has failed.

The following interceptors are used by default, and if enabled, called in this order:

* exception interceptor 
* logging interceptor
* decode failure handler interceptor

Note that while the request will be passed top-to-bottom, handling of the result will be done in opposite order. 
E.g., if the result is a failed effect (an exception), it will first be logged by the logging interceptor, and 
only later passed to the exception interceptor.

Using `customInterceptors` on the options companion object, it is possible to customise the built-in interceptors, as 
well as add new ones in-between the default initial (exception, logging) and decode failure interceptors. Customisation 
can include removing the interceptor altogether. Later, interceptors can be added using `.prependInterceptor` and 
`.appendInterceptor`.
