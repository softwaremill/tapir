# Running as a Play server

Tapir supports both Play 2.9, which still ships with Akka, and Play 3.0, which replaces Akka with Pekko.
See the [Play framework documentation](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.9.x/General#How-Play-Deals-with-Akkas-License-Change) for differences between these versions.

To expose an endpoint as a [play-server](https://www.playframework.com/), using **Play 2.9 with Akka**, add the following dependencies:

```scala
"com.softwaremill.sttp.tapir" %% "tapir-play29-server" % "1.9.6"
```

and (if you don't already depend on Play)

```scala
"org.playframework" %% "play-akka-http-server" % "2.9.1"
```

or

```scala
"org.playframework" %% "play-netty-server" % "2.9.1"
```

depending on whether you want to use netty or Akka based http-server under the hood. Please note that Play 2.9 server is available only for Scala 2.13.

To expose an endpoint as a [play-server](https://www.playframework.com/), using **Play 3.0 with Pekko**, add the following dependencies:

```scala
"com.softwaremill.sttp.tapir" %% "tapir-play-server" % "1.9.6"
```

and (if you don't already depend on Play)

```scala
"org.playframework" %% "play-pekko-http-server" % "3.0.0"
```

or

```scala
"org.playframework" %% "play-netty-server" % "3.0.0"
```

depending on whether you want to use netty or Pekko based http-server under the hood.

The following code samples use **Play 3.0 with Pekko**. If you are using Play 2.9 with Akka,
simply replace the import of `org.apache.pekko.stream.Materializer` with `import akka.stream.Materializer`.

Then import the object:

```scala
import sttp.tapir.server.play.PlayServerInterpreter
```

The `toRoutes` method requires a single, or a list of `ServerEndpoint`s, which can be created by adding
[server logic](logic.md) to an endpoint. For example:

```scala
import org.apache.pekko.stream.Materializer
import play.api.routing.Router.Routes
import sttp.tapir._
import sttp.tapir.server.play.PlayServerInterpreter

import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import scala.concurrent.Future

implicit val materializer: Materializer = ???

def countCharacters(s: String): Future[Either[Unit, Int]] =
  Future(Right[Unit, Int](s.length))

val countCharactersEndpoint: PublicEndpoint[String, Unit, Int, Any] =
  endpoint.in(stringBody).out(plainBody[Int])
val countCharactersRoutes: Routes =
  PlayServerInterpreter().toRoutes(countCharactersEndpoint.serverLogic(countCharacters _))
```

```eval_rst
.. note::

  A single Play application can contain both tapir-managed and Play-managed routes. However, because of the
  routing implementation in Play, the shape of the paths that tapir and other Play handlers serve should not
  overlap. The shape of the path includes exact path segments, single- and multi-wildcards. Otherwise, request handling
  will throw an exception. We don't expect users to encounter this as a problem, however the implementation here
  diverges a bit comparing to other interpreters.
```

## Bind the routes

### Creating the HTTP server manually

An HTTP server can then be started as in the following example:

```scala
import play.core.server._
import play.api.routing.Router.Routes

val aRoute: Routes = ???

object Main {
  // JVM entry point that starts the HTTP server
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val playConfig = ServerConfig(port =
      sys.props.get("http.port").map(_.toInt).orElse(Some(9000))
    )
    NettyServer.fromRouterWithComponents(playConfig) { components =>
      aRoute
    }
  }
}
```

### As part of an existing Play application

Or, if you already have an existing Play application, you can create a `Router` class and bind it to the application.

First, add a line like following in the `routes` files:
```
->      /api                        api.ApiRouter
```
Then create a class like this:
```scala
class ApiRouter @Inject() () extends SimpleRouter {
  override def routes: Routes = {
    anotherRoutes.orElse(tapirGeneratedRoutes)
  }
}
```

Find more details about how to bind a `Router` to your application in the [Play framework documentation](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/ScalaSirdRouter#Binding-sird-Router).

## Web sockets

The interpreter supports web sockets, with pipes of type `Flow[REQ, RESP, Any]`. See [web sockets](../endpoint/websockets.md)
for more details.

The interpreter does not expose control frames (`Ping`, `Pong` and `Close`), so any setting regarding them are discarded, however those that are emitted are sent to the client.

## Configuration

The interpreter can be configured by providing a `PlayServerOptions` value, see
[server options](options.md) for details.
