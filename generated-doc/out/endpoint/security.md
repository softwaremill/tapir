# Security

Endpoints can have dedicated security-related inputs. The type of those inputs is captured as the first type parameter,
`A`, of the `Endpoint` type. Security inputs can be added by `.securityIn` methods, and behave the same as regular 
inputs.

The security inputs play a crucial role when defining the [server logic](../server/logic.md) for an endpoint. They also
aim to clearly communicate which part of the endpoint's input is security-related. Finally, they are part of a mechanism
for building reusable base "secure" endpoints, either with the security logic provided or not, which can later be 
extended by other endpoints.

## Authentication inputs

Inputs which map to authentication credentials can be created using methods available in the `auth` object. Such
inputs in addition to the base input (such as an `Authorization` header or a cookie), contain security-related metadata, 
for example the name of the security scheme that should be used for documentation.

```eval_rst
.. note::

  Note that security inputs added using ``.securityIn`` can contain both dedicated auth credentials inputs created
  using one of the methods from ``auth``, and arbitrary "regular" inputs, such as path components. Similarly, regular 
  inputs can contain inputs created through ``auth``, though typically this shouldn't be the case.
```

Currently, the following authentication inputs are available (assuming `import sttp.tapir._`):

* `auth.apiKey(anotherInput)`: wraps any other input and designates it as an api key. The input is typically a header, 
cookie or a query parameter
* `auth.basic[T]`: reads data from the `Authorization` header, removing the `Basic ` prefix. To parse the data as a 
base64-encoded username/password combination, use: `basic[UsernamePassword]`.
* `auth.bearer[T]`: reads data from the `Authorization` header, removing the `Bearer ` prefix. To get the token
as a string, use: `bearer[String]`.
* `auth.oauth2.authorizationCode(authorizationUrl, scopes, tokenUrl, refreshUrl): EndpointInput[String]`: creates an 
OAuth2 authorization using authorization code - sign in using an auth service (for documentation, requires defining also 
the `oauth2-redirect.html`, see [Generating OpenAPI documentation](..docs/openapi.md))

## Authentication challenges

For each `auth` scheme, one can define `WWW-Authenticate` headers that should be returned by the server in case input is 
not provided. Default behavior is to return `401` status with the headers needed for authentication. To return different
status codes when authentication is missing, the decode failure handler can [be customised](../server/errors.md).

For example, if you define `endpoint.get.securityIn("path").securityIn(auth.basic[UsernamePassword]())` then the browser
will show you a password prompt.

## Grouping authentication inputs in docs

Optional and multiple authentication inputs have some additional rules as to how hey map to documentation, see the
["Authentication inputs and security requirements"](../docs/openapi.md) section in the OpenAPI docs for details.
