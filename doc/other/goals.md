# Goals of the project

* programmer-friendly, human-comprehensible types, that you are not afraid to write down
* (also inferencable by IntelliJ)
* discoverable API through standard auto-complete
* separate "business logic" from endpoint definition & documentation
* as simple as possible to generate a server, client & docs
* based purely on case class-based, immutable and reusable data structures
* first-class OpenAPI support. Provide as much or as little detail as needed.
* reasonably type safe: only, and as much types to safely generate the server/client/docs
