# Migrating

## From 1.4 to 1.5

- `badRequestOnPathErrorIfPathShapeMatches` and `badRequestOnPathInvalidIfPathShapeMatches` have been removed from `DefaultDecodeFailureHandler`. These flags were causing confusion and incosistencies caused by specifics of ZIO and Play backends. Before tapir 1.5, keeping defaults (`false` and `true` respectively for these flags) meant that some path segment decoding failures (specifically, errors - when an exception has been thrown during decoding, but not for e.g. enumeration mismatches) were translated to a "no-match", meaning that the next endpoint was attempted. From 1.5, tapir defaults to a 400 Bad Request response to be sent instead, on all path decoding failures.
- If your code sets `badRequestOnPathErrorIfPathShapeMatches = true` to override the default `false`, you can just remove this in tapir 1.5, it is the new default.
- Similarly, if your code sets `.badRequestOnDecodeFailure` on endpoint path input, just remove this attribute.
- If your code doesn't change this parameter and you update tapir, you should expect shape-matched path decoding failures to always become 400s, without attempting the next endpoint unless explicitly specified.
- If you want to override this behavior and force trying the next endpoint, add `.onDecodeFailureNextEndpoint` to the input where you expect such handling. See [error handling page](server/errors.html#default-failure-handler) for details.

## From 1.2 to 1.3

- Static content endpoints from `sttp.tapir.static._` are deprecated in favor of the new `tapir-files` module. New methods are in `sttp.tapir.files._`: `staticFilesGetServerEndpoint`, `staticFilesHeadServerEndpoint`, `staticFilesServerEndpoints`, `staticResourcesGetServerEndpoint`, `staticResourcesHeadServerEndpoint`, `staticResourcesServerEndpoints`, etc. See the [updated documentation](endpoint/static.md).
- Respectively, use `sttp.tapir.files.FilesOptions` instead of `sttp.tapir.static.FilesOptions`
- the `cats` integration module has been split into `cats` and `cats-effect`, with the latter containing the `CatsMonadError` class, providing a bridge between the sttp-internal `MonadError` and the cats-effect `Sync` typeclass. If you've been using this directly, you might need to update your dependencies.

## From 0.20 to 1.0

- `EndpointVerifier` is moved to a separate `tapir-testing` module
- `customJsonBody` is renamed to `customCodecJsonBody`
- `anyFromStringBody` is renamed to `stringBodyAnyFormat`
- `anyFromUtf8StringBody` is renamed to `stringBodyUtf8AnyFormat`
- `CustomInterceptors` is renamed to `CustomiseInterceptors` as this better reflects the functionality of the class
- `CustomiseInterceptors.errorOutput` is renamed to `.defaultHandlers`, with additional options added.
- in custom server interpreters, the `RejectInterecptor` must be now disabled explicitly using `RejectInterceptor.disableWhenSingleEndpoint` when a single endpoint is being interpreted; the `ServerInterpreter` no longer knows about all endpoints, as it is now parametrised with a function which gives the potentially matching endpoints, given a `ServerRequest`
- the names of Prometheus and OpenTelemetry metrics have changed; there are now three metrics (requests active, total and duration), instead of the previous 4 (requests active, total, response total and duration). Moreover, the request duration metric includes an additional label - phase (either headers or body), measuring how long it takes to create the headers or the body.
- `CustomiseInterceptors.appendInterceptor` is replaced with `.addInterceptor`; `.prependInterceptor` and `.appendInterceptor` methods are also added
- `RequestHandler`, returned by `RequestInterceptor`, now also accepts a list of server endpoints. This allows to dynamically filter the endpoints. Moreover, there's a new type parameter in `RequestInterceptor` and `RequestHandler`, `R`, specifying the capabilities required by the given server endpoints.
- the http4s server interpreters have only one effect parameter, instead of two (`F` for the general effect and `G` for the body effect). This separation stopped making sense with the introduction of `BodyListener` some time ago and keeping `ServerInterpreter` using a single effect.
- the Swagger and Redoc UIs by default use relative paths for yaml/json documentation references and for redirects. This can be changed by passing appropriate options.
- The `streamBinaryBody` method now has a mandatory `format` parameter, which previously was fixed to be `CodecFormat.OctetStream()`

### Moved traits, classes, objects

- server interpreters & interceptors have moved from `core` into the `server/core` module
- `ServerResponse` and `ValuedEndpointOutput` are moved to `sttp.tapir.server.model`
- metrics classes and interceptors have moved to the `sttp.tapir.server.metrics` package
- `Endpoint.renderPathTemplate` is renamed to `Endpoint.showPathTemplate`
- web socket exceptions `UnsupportedWebSocketFrameException` and `WebSocketFrameDecodeFailure` are now in the `sttp.tapir.model` package
- OpenAPI and AsyncAPI models are now part of a separate sttp-apispec project, hence the packages of these objects changed as well, from `sttp.tapir.apispec` / `sttp.tapir.openapi` / `sttp.tapir.asyncapi` to `sttp.tapir.apispec.(...)`
- server interpreters sources are now grouped based on the underlying server implementation (e.g. http4s, vertx), and then sub-directories contain effect integrations (e.g. cats, zio). Name templates:
  - for artifacts: `tapir-<server>-server-<effect>`. E.g. `tapir-zio-http4s-server` became `tapir-http4s-server-zio1`
  - for package names: `sttp.tapir.server.<server>.<effect>`
  - for interpreters: `<server><effect>ServerInterpreter`
