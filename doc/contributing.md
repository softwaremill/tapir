# Contributing

All suggestions welcome :)!

If you'd like to contribute, see the list of [issues](https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir/issues) and pick one! 
Or report your own. If you have an idea you'd like to discuss, that's always a good option.

If you are having doubts on the *why* or *how* something works, don't hesitate to ask a question on
[discourse](https://softwaremill.community/c/tapir) or via github. This probably means that the documentation, scaladocs or 
code is unclear and can be improved for the benefit of all.
