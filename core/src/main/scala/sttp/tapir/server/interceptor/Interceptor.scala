  *
  *   - customise the request that is passed downstream
  *   - short-circuit further processing and provide an alternate (or no) response
  *   - replace or modify the response that is sent back to the client
  *
  * Interceptors can be called when the request is started to be processed (use [[RequestInterceptor]] in this case), or for each endpoint,
  * with either input success of failure decoding events (see [[EndpointInterceptor]]).
  *
  * To add an interceptors, modify the server options of the server interpreter.

/** Allows intercepting the handling of `request`, before decoding using any of the endpoints is done. The request can be modified, before
  * invoking further behavior, passed through `requestHandler`. Ultimately, when all interceptors are run, logic decoding subsequent
  * endpoint inputs will be run.
  *
  * A request interceptor is called once for a request.
  *
  * Instead of calling the nested behavior, alternative responses can be returned using the `responder`.
  *
  * Moreover, when calling `requestHandler`, an [[EndpointInterceptor]] can be provided, which will be added to the list of endpoint
  * interceptors to call. The order in which the endpoint interceptors will be called will correspond to their order in the interceptors
  * list in the server options. An "empty" interceptor can be provided using [[EndpointInterceptor.noop]].
