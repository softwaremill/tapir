    * If you intend to use this HTTP server for any deployments that will run under load it's absolutely necessary to set an executor that
    * will use proper thread pool to handle the load. Recommended approach is to use `JdkHttpServerOptions.httpExecutor` method to create a
    * ThreadPoolExecutor that will scale under load. You can also use an Executor returned from any of the constructors in the
    * `java.util.concurrent.Executors` class.
    *
    * Alternatively, if running with a JDK 19+ you can leverage Project Loom and use `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()` to run
    * each request on a virtual thread. This however means it is possible for your server to be overloaded with work as each request will be
    * given a thread with no backpressure on how many should be executed in parallel.
